#######################

* MAIN DESCRIPTION:

* APPRIS-DATA:
	
* APPRIS-CODE, v1.3

	- (main) APPRIS
		- Take into account the cached files of gtf and aligments.
		- Include new changed path as parameter
		- Now appris can not execute 'none' method.
		- Include new description for inputs. [inpath,ensembl,gencode,sequence] # TODO !!		

	- INERTIA
		- New version of inertia that runs all pipeline in one script.

	- CORSAIR TODO!!!!!
		- Acquires the scores using the range of exon-miniexons.
		- Acquires the scores using without any exon information (using only the sequence).

	- MATADOR3D TODO!!!!!
		- Acquires the scores using without any exon information (using only the sequence).

	- MATADOR3D TODO!!!!!
		- New decision in the algorithm:
			The first variants have to overcome in 0.5 to seconds.
			Then, the seconds have to overcome in 0.5 to the thirds.

# RELEASE:  3.2.1     #
#######################

* MAIN DESCRIPTION:

	
* APPRIS-DATA:

- Include "chromosome" column within "conserved_exons" data.

- Human
	> Gencode 19, gen19.v1.25Nov2013

	> Gencode 15, g15.v4.16Oct2013
	
- Mouse
	> Ensembl70, e70.v4.29Oct2013

- Rat
	> Ensembl70, e70.v4.29Oct2013

- Zebrafish
	> Ensembl70, e70.v1.25Nov2013


* APPRIS-WEBSITE:


* APPRIS-CODE:

- v1.2:

	- Put together README files
	
	- (main) APPRIS
		- Modify the way to obtain the inputs
			- Type of inputs: 
				- directory data (cached)
				- gencode data
				- ensembl data
				- sequence (protein) data
			- Type of alignment:
				- compara
		- Delete runner files				

		- Add INERTIA script
		- Accepts new parameters. 't-align' that describes the type of alignment.
			- Type of alignment:
				- compara		

	- CORSAIR
		- New scores for the Lynx pardinus
		- New cutoff of 1.5
		- Include the list of species for 'Danio rerio'
	
	- MATADOR3D
		- The gene ENSG00000160404 is rejecting ENST00000373284 with an negative alignment -0.20125 because 
		the percentage of gaps is bigger than 25.
		We have modify the threshold of percentages of gaps to:
		
				elsif ($gaps > 25)
					{ $totalgaps = 0 }
				elsif ($gaps > 33)
					{ $totalgaps = -0.5 }
				elsif ($gaps > 40)
				
		- Take the correct transcript		
		- Change the threshold of Matador3D to 0.65

	- APPRIS
		- Reliability scores:
			If transcript is UNKOWN, its reliability score is NR (not rejected).
			And if the transcript has the longest protein sequences, its reliability score is NR*
			
			Only the transcripts with PRICIPAL have reliability scores.
		- If we don't have information of codons, we continue saving the appris score.

	- THUMP		
		- Changes the regular expresion to parse transcript for any kind of identifier.

# RELEASE:  3.1.1       #
#########################

* APPRIS-WEBSITE:

- Links of archives redirect to more specific website.

- Rename the suffix of data files of 'rattus_norvegicus'.

- Change the annotations of SPADE and THUMP. Now, we print their "scores" in the website:
	- SPADE shows an float number where the absolute number is the pfam domains that are detected. Then, the number after the decimal indicates the numbers of partial domains.
	- THUMP shows the number of TMH detected. Again, the number after the decimal indicates the partial TMH.
 
- Delete the phrase "on Human (GRCh37/hg19) Assembly" from the 'report' web page.

- Fix the URL that retrieves proteomics data as BED format.

- Update the proteomic data (gencode12):
	- Peptides were assembled from five previously available proteomics data sets. Three of the peptide data sets came from published large-scale experiments (Ezkurdia, Nagaraj, Geiger) 
	and the others were from two large spectra libraries, PeptideAtlas (Farrah) and NIST (http://peptide.nist.gov/).
	These tracks show where peptide evidence exists (0 or 1) , but there is no means of scoring these tracks.

# RELEASE:  3.1         #
#########################


* MAIN DESCRIPTION:


* APPRIS-CODE:

We have decided to establish new nomenclature of version of appris's code.

- v1.1:

	- SPADE does not migrate domains of variants with the same sequence where pfamscan does not provide results. 
		For example, ENSG00000021300.7 (Gencode 15)
		
	- FIRESTAR prints results whose cutoff is smaller than 65%. This is bad!!! 
	For example, ENSG00000184361 (Gencode 15)

	- CORSAIR, v10. We have added the new scores of the rest of species (including Lynx pardinus):
		'Rest of species'
			'Homo sapiens'				=> 1,
			'Pan troglodytes'			=> 1,
			'Mus musculus'				=> 1.1,
			'Rattus norvegicus'			=> 1.1,
			'Bos taurus'				=> 1.2,
			'Canis lupus familiaris'	=> 1.2,
			'Sus scrofa'				=> 1.2,
			'Monodelphis domestica'		=> 1.3,
			'Gallus gallus'				=> 2,
			'Taeniopygia guttata'		=> 2,
			'Anolis carolinensis'		=> 2,
			'Xenopus tropicalis'		=> 2.2,
			'Tetraodon nigroviridis'	=> 2,
			'Danio rerio'				=> 2.5,

* APPRIS-DATA:

- Human
	> Gencode 12, rel12.27Jun2013.v5
		- SPADE did not migrate variant domains with the same sequence.
		- INERTIA new results.

	> Gencode 15, g15.v3.15Jul2013
		- SPADE did not migrate variant domains with the same sequence.		
		- FIRESTAR printed results whose cutoff was smaller than 65%.

* NEW GENOMES:

- Mouse
	> Ensembl70, e70.v3.15Jul2013
		- SPADE did not migrate variant domains with the same sequence.		
		- FIRESTAR printed results whose cutoff was smaller than 65%.

- Rat
	> Ensembl70, e70.v3.10Jul2013
		- SPADE did not migrate variant domains with the same sequence.		
		- FIRESTAR printed results whose cutoff was smaller than 65%.


* APPRIS-WEBSITE:
	
	- Add script for the rest of species
	
	- Include new data files into website:
		- appris data exon by exon
		
	- Modify "download" web page.
