PREREQUISITES
=============

Unix/Linux
Perl 5.6 or later
    
INSTALL
=======

Change current directory to the directory where you want to install phobius
(e.g. /usr/local/share/), and unpack the tar file with the command:

cat /path_to_tarfile/phobius.tar.gz | tar xz

make a link from the file phobius.pl to a directory included in your standard
path.

ln -s /usr/local/share/phobius/phobius.pl /usr/local/bin/phobius

Make sure that the gnuplot package is available in the standard path, if you
want to be able to generate posterior probability plots.
