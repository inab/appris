Originally the code for SLR was build on several other libraries
although these dependencies have now be removed from the code base.

Thanks to the following:

Meschach library (David Stewart, des@thrain.anu.edu.au)
  A linear algebra library written in C.

Brent minimizer (Oleg Keselyov, oleg@ponder.csci.unt.edu)
  Brent's method of minimization in one dimension.

The original code for both these libraries can be obtained from 
http://www.netlib.org/c/

Hash table functions (Farooq Mela fmela@uci.edu)
   Dictionary library (hash tables and tree-based structures).
